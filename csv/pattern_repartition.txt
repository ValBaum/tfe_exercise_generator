The first column corresponds to the exercise number, the second column to the
category and the third column contains the different patterns used.

To create a pattern dot cloud; simple print a dot when the pattern appears, where,
The x-axis corresponds to the pattern number and the y-axis is the exercise numbers

To create the distribution graphs I have counted all the occurrence of each pattern
for each category and I have divided by the total number of expressions for the
category
